# Modeling-Late-Payments-For-Credit-Card-Bills

In this project my task was to predict 3 different targets. They are all binary classification and have the same data fields. 
Data Preprocess:
The given data had many NaN values. I had to remove columns that have more than 40% NaN values with eraseUnwanted(data) method. After this I had to fill remaining NaN values in data. For number values that are missing, I used filling with mean. For String values, I used filling with most frequent. In order to have same features in test and train data, I added test data to train data as new data points and sent the joint data points through the same preprocess.

      Learners
	I used Random Forest, K-nn and LogisticRegression as learners. Most successful one was random forest in terms of AUROC. I used Logistic Regression to ensemble Random Forest and K-nn by using Random Forest and k-nnâ€™s predictions as input data to train Logistic Regression. 

      AUROC
	I calculated each learners AUROC and score. I also drew the ROC curve for each one. In order to get a meaningful result I used probability of having a prediction value of 1 as AUROC input.
